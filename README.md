# Smart Waste Dashboard

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) + FastAPI project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It provides a Smart Waste Tracker Dashboard with data fetched from a Python FastAPI backend.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-waste-dashboard.git
cd smart-waste-dashboard
````

*(Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username or repo owner.)*

---

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

From the project root folder, install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

---

### 3. Run the Backend (FastAPI)

In a **new terminal window/tab**, start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

‚úÖ The backend will be running at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

### 4. Run the Frontend (Next.js)

In **another terminal window/tab**, from the project root, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This starts the Next.js development server at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Access the Dashboard

* Backend API ‚Üí [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* Frontend ‚Üí [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Make sure both the backend and frontend are running for the app to work correctly.
